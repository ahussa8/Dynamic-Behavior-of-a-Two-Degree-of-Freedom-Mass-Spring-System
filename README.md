# Dynamic-Behavior-of-a-Two-Degree-of-Freedom-Mass-Spring-System
Performed modal analysis of a two-degree-of-freedom mass-spring system by deriving equations of motion, computing natural frequencies, and solving for time-dependent displacements under initial conditions using analytical methods in MATLAB and manual calculations.
